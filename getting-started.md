# Getting started

## How does Chopper work?

Due to limitations to Dart on Flutter and the Web browser, Chopper doesn't use reflection but code generation with the help of the [build](https://pub.dev/packages/build) and [source\_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/source_gen) packages from the Dart Team.

## Installation

Add the `chopper` and the `chopper_generator` packages to your project dependencies.

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml

dependencies:
  chopper: ^3.0.7

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.12.1
  chopper_generator: ^3.0.7
```

Run `pub get` to start using Chopper in your project.

## Define your API

### ChopperApi

To define a client, use the `@ChopperApi` annotation on an abstract class that extends the `ChopperService` class.

```dart
// YOUR_FILE.dart

import "dart:async";
import 'package:chopper/chopper.dart';

// This is necessary for the generator to work.
part "YOUR_FILE.chopper.dart";

@ChopperApi(baseUrl: "/todos")
abstract class TodosListService extends ChopperService {

  // A helper method that helps instantiating the service. You can omit this method and use the generated class directly instead.
  static TodosListService create([ChopperClient? client]) => 
      _$TodosListService(client);
}
```

The `@ChopperApi` annotation takes one optional parameter - the `baseUrl` - that will prefix all the request's URLs defined in the class.

> There's an exception from this behavior described in the [Requests](requests.md) section of the documentation.

### Defining a request

Use one of the following annotations on abstract methods of a service class to define requests:

* `@Get` 

* `@Post` 

* `@Put`

* `@Patch`

* `@Delete`

* `@Head`

Request methods must return with values of the type `Future<Response>`, `Future<Response<SomeType>>` or `Future<SomeType>`.
The `Response` class is a wrapper around the HTTP response that contains the response body, the status code and the error (if any) of the request.
This class can be omitted if only the response body is needed. When omitting the `Response` class, the request will throw an exception if the response status code is not in the range of `< 200` to ` > 300`.

To define a `GET` request to the endpoint `/todos` in the service class above, add one of the following method declarations to the class:

```dart
@Get()
Future<Response> getTodos();
```

or

```dart
@Get()
Future<Response<List<Todo>>> getTodos();
```

or

```dart
@Get()
Future<List<Todo>> getTodos();
```

URL manipulation with dynamic path, and query parameters is also supported. To learn more about URL manipulation with Chopper, have a look at the [Requests](requests.md) section of the documentation. 

## Defining a ChopperClient

After defining one or more `ChopperService`s, you need to bind instances of them to a `ChopperClient`. The `ChopperClient` provides the base URL for every service and it is also responsible for applying [interceptors](interceptors.md) and [converters](converters/converters.md) on the requests it handles.

```dart
import "dart:async";
import 'package:chopper/chopper.dart';

import 'YOUR_FILE.dart';

void main() async {
  final chopper = ChopperClient(
      baseUrl: "http://my-server:8000",
      services: [
        // Create and pass an instance of the generated service to the client
        TodosListService.create()
      ],
    );

  /// Get a reference to the client-bound service instance...
  final todosService = chopper.getService<TodosListService>();
  /// ... or create a new instance by explicitly binding it to a client.
  final anotherTodosService = TodosListService.create(chopper);

  /// Making a request is as easy as calling a function of the service.
  final response = await todosService.getTodos();
  
  if (response.isSuccessful) {
    // Successful request
    final body = response.body;
  } else {
    // Error code received from server
    final code = response.statusCode;
    final error = response.error;
  }
}
```

Handling I/O and other exceptions should be done by surrounding requests with `try-catch` blocks.
