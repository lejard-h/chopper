# The CI setup of the project

⚠️ This document is heavily WIP. It will contain the full CI setup guide for this project.

## Generating the CI config

We use the [`mono_repo`](https://pub.dev/packages/mono_repo) Dart package project for generating the GitHub CI config.

To install and use `mono_repo`, refer to its official documentation linked above.
