<summary>Code sample</summary>

<!--
      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

      To create it you can use `dart create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
      which is capable of creating and running small Dart apps.

      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
      we regretfully will have to close it.

```dart

<!--
      Run your application with `dart run main.dart --verbose` and attach all the
      log output below between the lines with the backticks. If there is an
      exception, please see if the error message includes enough information
      to explain how to solve the issue.
-->

```
```

<!--
     Run `dart analyze` and attach any output of that command below.
     If there are any analysis errors, try resolving them before filing this issue.
